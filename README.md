# 🎬 Movie Sentiment Analysis Project

## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to analyze comments on movie trailers and predict sentiment as either positive or negative. Our objective is to provide movie studios, OTT platforms, and distributors with real-time sentiment analysis to tailor marketing strategies and PR campaigns more effectively.
## 🔍 Problem Statement
- Movie studios, OTT platforms, and distributors struggle to gauge accurate audience sentiment towards movies using traditional methods, which are often time-consuming and lack real-time insights

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Develop an automated solution to reduce time and effort in sentiment analysis.
- Provide real-time sentiment analysis to quickly understand audience reactions.
- Use sentiment data to tailor marketing strategies and PR campaigns of movies more effectively.

## 📊 Data Source
- **Dataset:** IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis from Kaggle.
